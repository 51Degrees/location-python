## @example cloud/web.py
#
# This example is designed to output location data using the client-side evidence feature of the pipeline.
#
# This example uses the client-side evidence feature of the Pipeline to get location information from the client.
# This information is used to populate properties containing JavaScript snippets, which are then bundled together into a single JavaScript block by the 'JsonBundler' and 'JavaScriptBuilder' elements.
# This JavaScript is then used to obtain the additional evidence from the client and pass it back to the server.
# The Pipeline running on the server then processes this evidence to populate a new JSON result object that is returned to the client.
#
# This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/location-python/blob/main/examples/cloud/web.py)
